Scenario 1: correct date might be in array of patt5 tup=date
[
    [
        tup1, matched with patt1
    ],
    [
        tup1, matched with patt3
    ],
    [
        tup1, matched with patt5
        tup2, matched with patt5
    ]
]

Scenario 2: correct date might be in array of patt1, since no pattern could match 2 dates we'll default to pattern priority
[
    [
        tup1, matched with patt1
    ],
    [
        tup1, matched with patt3
    ],
    [
        tup1, matched with patt5
    ]
]

Scenario 3: since we got 2 tups in given patt, we'll return the func.
[
    [
        tup1, matched with patt1
        tup2, matched with patt1
    ]
]

Scenario 4: if tuples match but format does not match, in that case do push to array.
